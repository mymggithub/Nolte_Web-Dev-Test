# Nolte_Web-Dev-Test
Repository for building a venue web app using foursquare.  


The goal is to create a simple place to go web application connected to the foursquare API.
The requirements are mostly open, but is should be web based.

The features should include:
- An ability to find a venue based on location. 
- Geolocation detection for current location. 
- The ability to share their favorite places on social channels. 
- Responsive (looks great on all screen sizes).
